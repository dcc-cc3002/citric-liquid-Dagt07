### Tarea 1

- Tarea 1 EP1 : Design of UML diagrams for the project sections 2.1 , 2.2 and 2.3 with the corresponding data type associations and methods.

- Tarea 1 EP2 : Test driven development and Implementation of the trait, abstractClass and classes necessary to build the section 2.3 _Board_. And some additional implementations for the section 2.1 _Units_ and section 2.2 _Norm_.

- Tarea 1 EF : Final implementation of sections 2.1 Units, 2.2 Norm with the corresponding tests (finishing EP1 and 2). 

### Tarea 2

- Tarea 2 EP3 : Implementation of getters and setters for the attributes of the classes, and their corresponding tests. Added some privacy to methods and attributes.

- Tarea 2 EP4 : Basic implementation of the combat system, with the corresponding tests.

- Tarea 2 EF : Final implementation of the combat system using Double Dispatch pattern, with the corresponding tests (finishing EP3 and 4).

### Tarea 3

- Tarea 3 EP5 : Added State design pattern Diagram.

- Tarea 3 EP6 : Basic implementation of the State and Controller design pattern.

- Tarea 3 EF : Final implementation of the game, with a basic GUI, using the State, Controller and Observer design pattern (finishing EP5 and 6) for modelling the game flow.

- Version 3.5.0 EP5: Added documentation and an update for UMLDiagram
- Version 2.5.9 CHORE norma level system changed. Splitted in various classes
- Version 2.5.8 Refactor specific panel methods to an apply() method
- Version 2.5.7 Refactor increaseVictories methods, inside the combat system
- Version 2.5.6 Refactor increaseStars and decreaseStars methods, inside the combat system
- Version 2.5.5 Added more tests for the combat system
- Version 2.5.4 Added Double Dispatch for the combat system, and respective tests cases
- Version 2.5.3 Added more tests for the panels
- Version 2.5.2 Added feature, panels now can add or remove other panels from the board, and tests for this feature
- Version 2.5.1 UML diagram of the project added to the repository
- Version 2.5.0 Feedback taken into account, 1) refactor all the NormaClass to various classes, one for each Norma level. 2) Style refactor for packages and classes names. 3) Added WildUnit trait(interface) to the overall design of the project
- Version 2.4.3 Moved away attacking calculus from inside the defend and evade method, to the attack method itself
- Version 2.4.2 Added AbstractUnit methods to attack, defend and evade
- Version 2.4.1 PlayerCharacter.rollDice() moved to AbstractUnit because now all units need to throw a die, for the combat system development.

- Version 1.2.1: Adjustment in some features and test's for the section 2.3 _Board_.
- Version 1.2.0: Test driven development and Implementation of the trait, abstractClass and classes necessary to build the section 2.3 _Board_. And some additional implementations for the section 2.1 _Units_ and section 2.2 _Norm_.
- Version 1.1.0: Design of UML diagrams for the project sections 2.1 , 2.2 and 2.3 with the corresponding data type assosiations and methods.
